### Development Time
1 Month w/ 1 Month Unity Experience.



<a name="evelopment-process"></a>
### Development Process
1. First thing I did was create a new unity project as well as a new <a href="https://miro.com/">miro</a> canvas.
2. The next step was to make sure I had a solid idea of the mechanics and features etc. that I wanted the game to have. [Mind Map](#mind-map)
3. Next I watched many YouTube tutorials on how a game should be structured and its basic architecture.
4. Finally I just started working on the game. I just followed my mind map and went step by step so that it would be more manageable.
